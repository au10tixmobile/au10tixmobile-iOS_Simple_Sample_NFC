## Overview
Verified, compliant and fraud-free onboarding results in eight seconds (or less). By the time you read this sentence, AU10TIX will have converted countless human smiles, identity documents and data points into authenticated, all-access passes to your products, services and experiences.

This example application presents an implementation suggestion for the Au10tix Mobile SDK NFC Module.

## Usage

 - To use this sample you have to edit the sample files according to the following steps.
 - The NFC frameworks should be requested separately from Au10tix

### JWT token
The SDK is prepared using the JWT token produced by the client's server.
Acquire the JWT token and modify MainViewController.swift 'prepare' method to correctly include the values obtained from your server.

```swift
func prepare()
    let jwtToken = ""
```

### Permissions
The AU10TIX SDK uses the device location and camera to produce photos containing metadata relevant to the authentication process. 
Both Camera and Location permissions must be declared, requested, and granted for the SDK to behave as expected.
You declare privacy permission usage descriptions in the info.plist of your application.
If you are viewing your applicationâ€™s info.plist file as a property list, you need to add usage description strings for the following property list keys:

    * Privacy - Camera Usage Description
    * Privacy - Location When in Use Usage Description

### NFC
Au10tix provides a convenient way to read NFC data directly from ID's chip and use it for further identity verification. There are both UI Components and NFC session functionality for it. To try NFC Kit please request it first from Au10tix, add to the project and run.
